// - a =
// - ... = unlimited number of them (a variadic parameter)
// - interface{} = it will take a value of any type
// n int, err error = what the func returns:
// - n = number of bytes written
// - err error = any write error it encounters
//When you see that a func has a parameter of this type "...interface{}" this is called a "variadic parameter"
//and it means that the func can take as many values of that type as you want to pass in.
